# Shikantaza Practice

The complete methodology for "just sitting" — the Soto Zen practice of seated meditation without object, goal, or technique, derived from Dogen Zenji's teaching that zazen is not a means to enlightenment but enlightenment itself manifesting.

## The Core Principle

"In zazen, do not try to become a Buddha. Do not think of good or evil. Just sit. This sitting is not a method to achieve something later. This sitting is itself the manifestation of Buddha-nature."
— Dogen Zenji

Shikantaza means "nothing but precisely sitting" or "just sitting." It is not a technique for achieving enlightenment — it IS enlightenment expressing itself through your body and mind, right now. There is nothing to add. There is nothing to remove. There is only sitting.

---

## The Revolutionary Distinction

Most meditation practices work like this: you sit, you apply a technique, and through the technique you hope to achieve a result. Shikantaza works differently. As Kodo Sawaki Roshi said: "Just sit zazen, and that's the end of it."

**Zazen is not meditation in the ordinary sense.**

Dogen's zazen is "first and foremost a holistic body posture, not a state of mind." When you sit correctly, with whole-body engagement, the practice is already complete. You do not then do something with your mind to make progress. The correct sitting itself is the expression of Buddha-nature.

## The Physical Foundation

### Posture

**The Legs:**
- Full Lotus: Right foot on left thigh, left foot on right thigh
- Half Lotus: Left foot pressed against right thigh (right foot under left thigh)
- Burmese: Both feet on the floor, one in front of the other
- Seiza: Kneeling on a bench or cushion
- Chair: If necessary, feet flat on floor, sitting forward

**The Spine:**
- Sit upright, neither leaning left nor right, neither forward nor backward
- Push the top of your head toward the ceiling, as if being pulled by a thread
- Let your belly relax forward slightly

**The Hands (Cosmic Mudra):**
- Left hand on right, palms up
- Thumbs lightly touching, forming an oval
- Rest hands in lap, against lower belly

**The Head and Face:**
- Ears aligned with shoulders
- Nose in line with navel
- Tongue gently touching the roof of the mouth
- Teeth and lips closed, not clenched
- Eyes open, gaze cast downward at about 45 degrees, unfocused

## The Mental Approach

### "Think Not-Thinking"

Dogen's famous instruction: "Think of not-thinking. How do you think of not-thinking? Non-thinking. This in itself is the essential art of zazen."

This is neither thinking nor suppressing thought. It is being aware without grasping or rejecting. Thoughts arise — let them. Thoughts pass — let them. You do not follow them. You do not fight them. You sit.

### The Four Often-Overlooked Dimensions

**1. Sit Wholeheartedly**
Trust that sitting itself is complete. There is nothing to add, no progress to make. Each moment of sitting is already whole. This is not laziness — it is radical acceptance that the practice contains everything.

**2. Accept Your Practice, Good or Bad**
Zazen is like weather — sometimes clear, sometimes stormy. A "good" sitting is not better than a "difficult" sitting. Do not evaluate. Just sit. The quality of your experience does not determine the value of your practice.

**3. Don't Measure**
Release attachment to duration, depth, achievement. Do not compare today's sitting to yesterday's. Do not count how many minutes. Each moment is infinite and complete. The practice transcends quantification.

**4. Go Beyond Your Self**
Eventually, the separation between sitter and sitting dissolves. There is just sitting — no one sitting, no sitting being done. This is "body and mind dropping off."

## The Practice Instructions

### Beginning

1. Take your seat on cushion, bench, or chair
2. Rock gently left and right, settling into stillness
3. Place hands in cosmic mudra
4. Adjust posture: ears over shoulders, nose over navel
5. Take one deep breath, then let breathing be natural
6. Open your eyes, gaze cast down, unfocused
7. Begin

### During

**What to do with the mind:**
Nothing.

When thoughts arise, do not engage. When thoughts pass, do not pursue. You are not trying to empty the mind — that would be another goal. You are not trying to be present — that would be another effort. You are just sitting.

If you notice you have been lost in thought, simply return to the posture. Do not scold yourself. Do not analyze what happened. Just return to sitting.

**What to do with the body:**
Maintain the posture. Let the posture breathe for you. Let the posture sit for you. The posture is not a container for meditation; the posture IS the practice.

### Ending

1. Do not rise abruptly
2. Rock gently left and right
3. Move slowly, calmly, deliberately
4. Let the quality of zazen infuse the movement

## The Philosophy Behind the Practice

### Practice-Realization Unity (Shusho Itto)

In Dogen's teaching, practice and enlightenment are not cause and effect. They are one continuous reality. You do not practice in order to become enlightened. When you practice correctly, enlightenment is already manifesting.

"We practice precisely because we are already Buddha."

This may seem paradoxical. If we are already enlightened, why practice? Because enlightenment is not a state to be achieved but a reality to be expressed. Practice is how Buddha-nature actualizes itself in the world.

### Why Posture Matters

Other traditions treat posture as preparation for mental practice. In shikantaza, posture IS the practice. When you "sit in kekka-fuza with body, sit in kekka-fuza with mind, sit in kekka-fuza of body-mind falling off," the physical and mental become inseparable.

The upright spine. The mudra. The gaze. These are not arbitrary forms. They are the shape of awakening.

## Common Obstacles

### Obstacle 1: "Nothing is happening"

**Response:** Good. Nothing is supposed to happen. The seeking-mind that wants something to happen is exactly what shikantaza releases. "Nothing happening" is the practice working.

### Obstacle 2: "I can't stop thinking"

**Response:** You are not supposed to stop thinking. You are supposed to sit. Thoughts arising is not failure. Getting lost in thought and returning to the posture — this is shikantaza. The return is not recovery from failure; the return IS the practice.

### Obstacle 3: "This is boring"

**Response:** Boredom is a thought. It arises and passes. You are not bored — you are sitting. Let boredom be, like any other thought. Do not entertain it. Do not fight it. Sit.

### Obstacle 4: "How do I know if I'm doing it right?"

**Response:** Check the posture. Is your spine upright? Ears over shoulders? Nose over navel? If the posture is correct, you are doing it right. There is no separate mental technique to evaluate. Just sit.

## How to Use This Skill

**When someone presents with:**
- "How do I meditate in Zen?"
- "What is shikantaza?"
- "How do I do zazen?"
- "I want a meditation without techniques"
- "How do I practice like Dogen taught?"

**Guide them through:**
1. Explain the distinction from goal-oriented meditation
2. Detail the physical posture completely
3. Clarify the "think not-thinking" instruction
4. Emphasize the four dimensions: wholehearted, accepting, non-measuring, self-transcending
5. Address the common obstacles
6. Point to the philosophy: practice IS enlightenment

## Sample Application

**Seeker says:** "I've tried many meditation techniques — focusing on the breath, mantras, visualizations. They all seem to require so much effort. Is there a simpler way?"

**Shikantaza Response:**

Yes. There is the simplest way — so simple it is often the hardest to trust.

Sit down. Assume the posture: spine upright, legs crossed or in chair, hands in your lap with thumbs touching. Let your gaze fall, eyes open. Breathe naturally.

Now: do nothing.

This is shikantaza — "just sitting." It is not a technique. There is no breath to follow, no mantra to repeat, no image to hold. There is only sitting.

"But what do I do with my mind?" you ask.

Nothing.

Thoughts will arise. Let them. Thoughts will pass. Let them. You are not trying to empty your mind — that would be doing something. You are not trying to be present — that would be effort. You are simply sitting.

This is harder than it sounds because we are addicted to doing. We believe we must achieve something, improve something, become something. Shikantaza asks you to give up all of that. Just sit. Trust that sitting is enough.

Dogen Zenji taught that zazen is not a method to become enlightened. Zazen IS enlightenment expressing itself through your body and mind. When you sit correctly, you are already expressing Buddha-nature. There is nothing to add.

Can you trust this? Can you sit without agenda, without measurement, without hope of progress?

This is the hardest thing — and the simplest. Just sit. The posture will teach you everything you need to know.
